        used to write the answer, with **validation-retry** on
        malformed responses.

        Mirrors the validation-retry pattern popularized by
        ``instructor``: when the LLM's JSON response fails any of
        our shape/content checks (wrong key name, wrong type, all
        hallucinated ids, empty list), we re-prompt with the
        specific error so the model can correct itself instead of
        falling back to reranker-picked chunks. ``json_repair``
        still handles syntax-level malformations (trailing commas,
        code fences, single quotes, unclosed braces) on every
        attempt; ``max_attempts`` governs the *semantic* retry
        loop on top of that.

        On 7B local models, semantic errors (wrong key name, list
        vs string, hallucinated id format) are common — this loop
        recovers the LLM's actual judgment instead of silently
        falling back. On 70B cloud models, the first attempt
        almost always succeeds and the loop is a no-op.

        Returns a list of validated chunk_ids in priority order
        (LLM's stated order). Empty list on terminal failure —
        caller should fall back to "use top-N reranked chunks for

        Algorithm:
          1. Split the answer into sentences.
          2. For each chunk_id in ``used_chunk_ids``, run the
             cross-encoder reranker over (chunk_text, sentence)
             pairs and pick the sentence with the highest score —
             that's the sentence this chunk best supports.
          3. Insert ``[cN]`` immediately after the chosen sentence.
             If two chunks land on the same sentence, both markers
             stack at that boundary.
          4. Build the citations list with the best sentence FROM
             the chunk (used by the highlight panel as ``quote``).

        Falls back gracefully:
          * No reranker → attach all used_chunk_ids as a final

          * No used_chunk_ids → uses top-2 reranker-scored chunks
            against the whole answer (so we never return uncited).
          * Empty answer or sources → return as-is.

        Per answer sentence, in order:
          1. Skip headings, short boilerplate, and refusal/disclaimer
             sentences (an honest "not in context" carries no claim
             to certify — stays uncited).
          2. Verbatim fast-path: an exact/near quote in a source chunk
             attaches instantly at score 1.0, no inference.
          3. Leftovers are scored against every chunk in ONE batched
             cross-encoder ``predict``; the best chunk attaches when
             it shows absolute certainty (score >= ``floor``) or
             distinctiveness (beats that sentence's mean chunk score
             by >= ``margin`` — scale-invariant, survives domain
             logit shift). An already-cited chunk re-attaches only
             when distinctly better than the best fresh alternative,
             so answers don't collapse onto one number.
        Unsupported sentences stay visibly uncited — never rewarded
        with a plausible-but-wrong reference.

        Returns ``(answer_with_markers, citations)`` — citations carry
        ``{chunk_id, quote, page, source, title, score, verified,
        attribution_method}``. ``score`` is always a plain float so
        the NDJSON frame stays JSON-serializable. Quotes diversify:
        sentences sharing one chunk get distinct passages, not the
        same line repeated.
